# Pi Day
The only reason it has Go in it is because I wanted to look at how Go works, otherwise it would be a GH Page

There's not much to it. The Go server is pretty neat but doesn't do a ton. The Javascript (public/the.js) handles everything.

Not the best code I've ever written, but far better than the worst code I've ever written.

Also, css `direction: rtl;` is wonky, so I came up with a work around so the text goes off the left of the screen.

Pi.js has 1 million digits of Pi in it, I doubt anyone will ever be able to remember that many off the top of their head, so we don't need to go any higher.

I made this the day before Pi Day, so if you see any blatant errors in Go code or JS code please take it easy on me.
